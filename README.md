# Generic-Api-Simulator
To simulate Web APIs via simple configuration

# About the Project

Most commonly, applications depend on external APIs. The developing and testing of the application 
is hindered when any one of these APIs is not available or the use of these APIs is restricted.

This project enables simulation of Rest APIs through configuration written in JSON format.
